! Function: psb_@X@_getelem
!    Extract entries from a dense  vector. Note: the row indices in index
!    are assumed to be in global numbering and are converted on the fly.
!    Row indices not belonging to the current process have to be in the halo,
!    othewise failure is ensured.
!
! Arguments:
!    x       - type(psb_@X@_vect_type) The source vector
!    desc_a  - type(psb_desc_type).    The communication descriptor.
!    index   - integer. Row index of x of the value to extract
!    iam     - integer. Index of the process requesting the value
!    info    - integer.                       return code
